Years ago I randomly discovered a rap song I loved. The flow, beat, and guy's voice was a perfect combination of what I'd only describe as the ultimate YOLO song. Curious about this song, and most importantly this artist, I decided to look him up.

I was around 14 back then. Spotify was open on my computer playing this song. I look at the song cover and see this:

And what's my 14-year-old, Spanish self's first thought?

> "Oh, this Donald Trump guy is such a good rapper. I can't find any other songs by him though, weird."

And that was it. No further self-analysis, no double take.

It took me until 2018 to revisit Mac Miller, only after hearing about his unfortunate overdose death.

That's when I realized who he actually was, and what my mistake had been all those years ago. I facepalmed. And then I listened to every one of his albums to my absolute delight. And then I listened to them many many more times. I guess subconsciously in some way I wanted to compensate for all those years I hadn't enjoyed his music due to pure stupidity. And the fact that I knew there wouldn't be any more music coming out of his soul made it less of an urge, and more of an absolute imperative. A debt to be payed for my younger self.

I fear that. I fear missing out on a sum of experiences I should be having just for pure stupidity, or, more accurately, lazyness. That album cover had two names in it. It'd have taken me 10 more seconds to Google that other name — resulting in years of enjoyment and a very devastating farewell — but it didn't even *cross my mind*. My 14-year-old underdeveloped [RAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCnfAzAIhVw) didn't pick up on it. A domino piece failed to sustain this particular chain reaction in my brain. And instead, I got to enjoy his progression as an artist second-handedly, and for all the wrong reasons.

And that's actually my biggest fear. The fear that whatever I do, I'm just a function of the initial singularity of the Universe, and all my thought processes and experiences, had and to be had, have already been determined and are completely out of my control. That in a way I'm just a puppet of a much bigger puppeteer, a domino piece in a giant chain reaction, with highly complex sensory abilities only perceived as its own. A puppet unable to see its own strings.

This morning, I decided to listen to that original Donald Trump song on repeat, and all of this came rushing to my mind. So here it is. If I wrote it out of pure free will or because it was universally bound to happen, I don't know. I can't know. I'll probably never know.

And that's okay. I'd even say it's probably better.
