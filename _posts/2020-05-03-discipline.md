My dad joined the air force when he was 18. Whether that's what he always wanted to do or not, I've never asked him. He's now warrant officer, working a comfortable office job. One can see in his being how immensely proud he still is to this day to have joined the force. And even though he's not arrogant about it — my dad is the most humble man I know — I know he wears it internally as a great accomplishment to have gotten where he is professionally today, and to be able to provide for my mom and my two younger sisters. To him, that's his personal, most valuable medal of honor.

He never pushed me into his career path either. He only brought it up once as a helpful suggestion in a period in my life where I wasn't clear on what I wanted to do, around the age of 15. But he understood: a son is not to become his father's shadow. And I'm profoundly grateful for that.

Throughout the years, little has been asked of me in exchange for the unconditional love I've always received from my parents. First of all: doing exceptionally well in school. Anything under a B+ was completely inconceivable, and unacceptable. It just didn't happen. They made sure it didn't happen by being constantly on top of my academic endeavours. Second of all: being a good kid. Throwing tantrums was completely off the books. Swearing was too. A bad or aggresive answer wasn't met without some solid parenting in return.

And so, I was always kept on check... up until around the point when I turned 16. By then my parents had 3 kids to take care of, and my belief is they couldn't stay on top of me as much as they used to, due to my younger sisters wanting their piece of attention. Without these measures in place, I started to become less and less interested in good grades, or high school as a whole. Thanks to some Internet influences I started to see "modern education" for what it is: an antiquated, mind-numbing, 9-to-5 time-slave making machine that hasn't changed in centuries and needs to die to be reborn as a completely different solution. So that didn't help with school motivation either. I also started eating whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. My parents no longer tried to get me to eat in family, because all I ever wanted to do after getting back from school was write code and watch TV shows. Writing code was a passion I developed when I was 12, and to this day I affirm: it's the only thing that kept me psychiatrically sane throughout high school.

This writing was prompted by a quote I read at some point in the past, which resurfaced in my mind today:

> "We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons."

I was stripped of my discipline, because my discipline never belonged to me in the first place. It had always been second-hand. Borrowed. From my parents. I was given too much second-hand discipline without allowing me to suffer the pain of regret enough to develop my own, and then all of a sudden it was gone. I don't blame my parents for this. Parenting is possibly the most challenging — if not impossible — mission in the world. A highly complex math equation to balance with internal as well as external random factors fully outside of one's control. They did what they thought was best, with nothing but their best intentions in mind, and I love them for it.

In a world where ephemeral, mindless, undeserved instant gratification is globally accessible, the modern struggle is the disease of abundance. And self-dicipline is one of, if not the most important trait to have in order to fight this disease back. Because stable, long-lasting happiness only comes from living aligned towards your purpose, being able to recognize temptation and *choose* when to allow it in. Anything else is but fleeting, illusory happiness at the cost of a lifetime of seemingly unexplainable dissatisfaction.

I know I can't attain discipline like my dad did in the air force. That's not what my purpose is.

But I'm working my hardest to figure out what that looks like for me. And every day that I wake up early, I read, I work out, I meditate, I shower, I work, I eat and I don't mindlessly masturbate because I *choose* to, I feel a small piece of a whole lifetime of happiness.
